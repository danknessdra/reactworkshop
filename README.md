    <summary style="font-size: 2rem">Explain components</summary>

* Components are like html elements made by us.
* You can make html elements that are highly complex, reactive, and styled.
* Components also allow for the javascript, styling, and associated data to be together in one place that makes sense
* One of the biggest advantages of components is their reusability.
* Reusing a component cleans up html files and removes duplicate sections, increasing readability

    <summary style="font-size: 2rem">Use components to try to build the website</summary>

* What is flex
    * a div with a css property allowing unique functionality
    * flexible container for holding items and automatically allocating space

You have been provided a product component. Make use of `<div>`, `<hr>`, and `<Product>`.

### Components can be made with other components inside of them

Now instead of placing them all by hand add the Product component to the shelf component and place 3 shelf components.
